## Gemini Added Memories
- Follow the PLAN.md task by task. After finishing each task, mark it as completed in PLAN.md and ask the user for the next command before proceeding.
- If PLAN.md is missing or has no tasks, create it (or add tasks) with detailed descriptions. ALWAYS wait for user confirmation of the plan before starting implementation. Once confirmed, proceed task-by-task, marking each as completed and waiting for the next command before starting the next task.
